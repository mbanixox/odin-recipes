    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africaâ€™s most popular dish. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Tomato Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large, ripe tomato, cored and quartered</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 whole habanero pepper, stem removed</li>
        <li>1 whole Fresno chili, or jalapeno, stem removed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup olive</li>
        <li>1 red onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped green onion for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and saute until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.
    </p>
    <h3>Step4</h3>
    <p>
        Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir the rice.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
        Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow the rice to sit and do not remove the lid.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>After the 12 minutes are up, remover the lid, and fluff the rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.</p>
    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>If the rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing. Pat the rice down gently with the back of the fork, cover tightly again, and set heat to medium low. Cook for another 5 minutes, and check again.</p>
